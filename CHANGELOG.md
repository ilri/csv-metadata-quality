## Unreleased
### Changed
- New AGROVOC REST API URL

## [0.7.0] - 2025-01-31
### Added
- Ability to normalize DOIs to https://doi.org URI format

### Fixed
- Fixed regex so we don't run the invalid multi-value separator fix on
`dcterms.bibliographicCitation` fields
- Fixed regex so we run the comma space fix on `dcterms.bibliographicCitation`
fields
- Don't crash the country/region checker/fixer when a title field is missing

### Changed
- Don't run newline fix on description fields
- Install requests-cache in main run() function instead of check.agrovoc() function so we only incur the overhead once
- Use py3langid instead of langid, see: [How to make language detection with langid.py faster](https://adrien.barbaresi.eu/blog/language-detection-langid-py-faster.html)
- Use uv instead of rye
- Remove pytest-clarity — I think pytest itself has gotten much better in the past few years

### Updated
- Python dependencies, including Pandas 2.0.0 and [Arrow-backed dtypes](https://datapythonista.me/blog/pandas-20-and-the-arrow-revolution-part-i)
- SPDX license list

## [0.6.1] - 2023-02-23
### Fixed
- Missing region check should ignore subregion field, if it exists

### Changed
- Use SPDX license data from SPDX themselves instead of spdx-license-list
because it is deprecated and outdated
- Require Python 3.9+
- Don't run `fix.separators()` on title or abstract fields
- Don't run whitespace or newline fixes on abstract fields
- Ignore some common non-SPDX licenses
- Ignore `__description` suffix in filenames meant for SAFBuilder when checking
for uncommon file extensions

### Updated
- Python dependencies

## [0.6.0] - 2022-09-02
### Changed
- Perform fix for "unnecessary" Unicode characters after we try to fix encoding
issues with ftfy
- ftfy heuristics to use `is_bad()` instead of `sequence_weirdness()`
- ftfy `fix_text()` to *not* change “smart quotes” to "ASCII quotes"

### Updated
- Python dependencies
- Metadatata field exclude logic

### Added
- Ability to drop invalid AGROVOC values with `-d` when checking AGROVOC values
with `-a <field.name>`
- Ability to add missing UN M.49 regions when both country and region columns
are present. Enable with `-u` (unsafe fixes) for now.

### Removed
- Support for reading Excel files (both `.xls` and `.xlsx`) as it was completely
untested

## [0.5.0] - 2021-12-08
### Added
- Ability to check for, and fix, "mojibake" characters using [ftfy](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/python-ftfy)
- Ability to check if the item's title exists in the citation
- Ability to check if an item has countries, but no matching regions (only
suggests missing regions if there is a region field in the CSV)

### Updated
- Python dependencies

### Fixed
- Regular expression to match all citation fields (dc.identifier.citation as
well as dcterms.bibliographicCitation) in `experimental.correct_language()`
- Regular expression to match dc.title and dcterms.title, but
ignore dc.title.alternative `check.duplicate_items()`
- Missing field name in `fix.newlines()` output

## [0.4.7] - 2021-03-17
### Changed
- Fixing invalid multi-value separators like `|` and `|||` is no longer class-
ified as "unsafe" as I have yet to see a case where this was intentional
- Not user visible, but now checks only print a warning to the screen instead
of returning a value and re-writing the DataFrame, which should be faster and
use less memory

### Added
- Configurable directory for AGROVOC requests cache (to allow running the web
version from Google App Engine where we can only write to /tmp)
- Ability to check for duplicate items in the data set (uses a combination of
the title, type, and date issued to determine uniqueness)

### Removed
- Checks for invalid and unnecessary multi-value separators because now I fix
them whenever I see them, so there is no need to have checks for them

### Updated
- Run `poetry update` to update project dependencies

## [0.4.6] - 2021-03-11
### Added
- Validation of dcterms.license field against SPDX license identifiers 

### Changed
- Use DCTERMS fields where possible in `data/test.csv`

- Run `poetry update` to update project dependencies

### Fixed
- Output for all fixes should be green, because it is good

## [0.4.5] - 2021-03-04

the error is
